# Bike_Ride_Condition_Checker_3000.exe

A simple python based program I made while studying in <b>(windy)</b> Amsterdam where my means of daily commute was biking. 
I made a log, tracking the wind speed and rain conditions and marked the quality of the bike ride, for two weeks. 

Afterwards, I wrote a python script that checks the weather conditions <i>(wind direction/speed, amount of rain)</i> near my dorms using a free weather API <i>(OpenWeather).</i>
Then using predetermined conditions (that were based on the observations recorded in the weather log) checks whether it's viable to take the bike or opt for the train.

I opted for a window requiring just one-click which I could just open in the morning before leaving to Uni; without the need to check the weather.

## <b> How to use:</b>
Download and Run the script, a simple window will pop-up with a button, click it to find the answer whether the conditions are suitable for biking or not. 

If you want to employ a "one-click" solution, write a simple notepad and save as .bat file with the following: path to your python.exe "path to Bike_Ride_Condition_Checker_3000.py".
There you go, windows now automatically opens the window for you!
