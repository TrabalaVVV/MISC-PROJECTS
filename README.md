## Bike_Ride_Condition_Checker_3000.exe

A simple python based program I made while studying in <b>(windy)</b> Amsterdam where my means of daily commute was biking. 
I made a log, tracking the wind speed and rain conditions and marked the quality of the bike ride, for two weeks. 

Afterwards, I wrote a python script that checks the weather conditions <i>(wind direction/speed, amount of rain)</i> near my dorms using a free weather API <i>(OpenWeather).</i>
Then using predetermined conditions (that were based on the observations recorded in the weather log) checks whether it's viable to take the bike or the train.

I opted for a window requiring just one-click which I could just open in the morning before leaving to Uni; without the need to check the weather.
